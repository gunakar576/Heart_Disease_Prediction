# Heart_Disease_Predictio

- This project uses machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease based on various clinical and demographic features. The goal is to help understand which factors are most correlated with heart disease and to build a predictive model that can assist in early diagnosis.

##  Project Overview

- Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction can help reduce risks through timely treatment and lifestyle adjustments. This project explores the use of logistic regression and other ML techniques on a heart disease dataset to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients.


##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (for EDA & visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for ML modeling)

## ðŸ§ª Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed EDA to:
- Visualize distribution of age, sex, chest pain, and cholesterol
- Understand relationships between features and the target variable
- Generate correlation heatmaps to identify key predictors

##  Model Building

- Applied **Logistic Regression** for binary classification
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - Accuracy score
